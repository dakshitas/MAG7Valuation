# MAG7 Valuation Model

This repository provides a comprehensive valuation framework for the "Magnificent Seven" (MAG7) technology companies:  
**Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and NVIDIA (NVDA)**.

The model integrates five core valuation methodologies to compare intrinsic and relative values across these market leaders.

---

## Objective

To evaluate and benchmark the valuation of MAG7 companies using a structured approach involving:
- Intrinsic valuation models
- Market-based comparables
- Strategic M&A precedents

---

## üßÆ Valuation Methods Included

### 1. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**
- Projects future free cash flows and discounts them using WACC
- Best for: Apple, Microsoft, Meta (predictable cash flows)

### 2. **Comparable Company Analysis (CCA)**
- Uses EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA multiples
- Useful for benchmarking Meta, Alphabet, and NVIDIA

### 3. **Precedent Transactions**
- Includes recent M&A activity in adjacent verticals
- Provides context but limited direct applicability for MAG7

### 4. **Market Capitalization**
- Quick market-based valuation snapshot
- Reflects investor sentiment and size

### 5. **EV/EBITDA Multiple**
- Adjusts for leverage, great for comparing Amazon, Tesla, and high CapEx firms
